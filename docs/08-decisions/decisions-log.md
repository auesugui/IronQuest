## Resolved Decisions (from PRD v2.0 Open Questions)

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Detail Doc |
|----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **A1** | **Auto-feed available.** Emotional bond comes from cosmetic customization, not feeding rituals | Manual feeding = friction without meaningful choice. Cosmetic shop = personal expression | [Pet Care](../04-pet-system/pet-care.md) |
| **A2** | **Quarterly prestige resets.** Tower resets every 3 months. Permanent badges for highest floor | CoD prestige model — reset feels like promotion, not loss. Prevents stagnation | [Battle Tower](../05-battle-tower/tower.md) |
| **A3** | **3 pet types** (Ferro/Terra/Flux) with elemental affinities. Chosen at game start | Identity + strategic layer. Disadvantages = challenge, not wall | [Pet Types](../04-pet-system/pet-types.md) |
| **A4** | **Self-contained tracker.** No external app integration | Data integrity essential for FP economy. Owns full data pipeline | [FP Economy](../02-forge-points/fp-economy.md) |
| **A5** | **No punishment for inactivity.** Gentle opt-in vacation mode | Life happens. Punishing absence = permanent churn | [Pet Care](../04-pet-system/pet-care.md) |
| **A6** | **FP buys both stats and cosmetics.** Two shops, one shared currency | Cosmetics extend engagement + personalization. Creates spending tension | [Cosmetics](../06-game-systems/cosmetics-achievements-quests.md) |
| **A7** | **AI integration deferred to Phase 4+.** Battle Advisor + Workout Coach | Requires stable economy + sufficient training data first | [Roadmap](../07-technical/architecture-and-roadmap.md) |

## Amendments Applied

| Amendment | What Changed | Affected Docs |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Spirit FP Exclusivity** | Removed Spirit from all cardio FP generation. Spirit earned only through streak system | Tracker Spec §4.1, §6.3. Addendum §B |
| **Smart Rest Timer** | Replaced simple countdown with 3-mode timer system: Active Rest, Pause, Extend. Added Equipment Transition Detection, Overrun Handling, Gym Rush Mode | Tracker Spec §3.1. Addendum §B.3 |
| **Cardio FP Correction** | LISS secondary: Spirit → Focus. Sport secondary: Spirit → Focus | Tracker Spec §4.1 |
| **Reduced Rest FP Bonus** | Explicitly tied to Gym Rush Mode toggle (opt-in) rather than passive detection | Addendum §B.3 |
