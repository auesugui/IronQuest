// These are NOT FP/engine calculations — they only filter, sort, and count
// already-claimed logs. The FP figures shown on the history screen come from
// `log.totalFP`, which was captured at claim time by the real engine (see
// src/lib/workout-summary.ts → calculateWorkoutSummary). Nothing here
// recomputes FP.
